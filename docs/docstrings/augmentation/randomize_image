randomize_image(image, p_same=0, p_rotate=0.75, p_flip=0.2,
                max_angle=10, max_shift=2,
                fixed_seeds=False, seed_count=10, seed_index=None)

Returns augmentation of dataset X and labels y. This augmentation
is produced by adding random transformations of each element of X.

Parameters
----------
image : 3-D array of size (1, height, width)
    image to be processed
p_same : float between 0 and 1
    probability of a given "transformation" being forced to be
    identical to the original
p_rotate : float between 0 and 1
    probability of applying a random rotation
p_flip : float between 0 and 1
    probability of reflecting the image horizontally
max_angle : nonnegative number < 360
    maximum rotation angle, in degrees
max_shift : nonnegative integer
    maximum number of pixels by which to translate in each direction
fixed_seeds : bool
    If fixed_seeds is True, "random" seeds will be deterministically
    computed for reproducibility, and there will be a set list
    of seeds  used so that only a certain number
    of image transformations are possible.
seed_count : positive integer
    If fixed_seeds is True, this is the number of possible
    transformations for each image.
seed_index : None or integer in range(seed_count)
    If fixed_seeds is True seed_index is None, a transformation will
    be selected from the list of possible transformations at random.
    If fixed_seeds is True and seed_index is not None, it selects a
    specific element from the set of possible transformations. This
    is used in the function augment_dataset to ensure that we get
    one of each transformation.

Returns
-------
image : the transformed image
