convert_arrays_to_accuracy(y1, y2)

This function returns the rate of agreement
between two sets of labels, so that, for example,
    convert_arrays_to_accuracy(model.predict(X_val),y_val)
should produce validation accuracy.

Parameters
----------
y1 : 2-D array with shape (number_of_examples, number_of_classes)
    a set of labels
y2 : 2-D array with shape (number_of_examples, number_of_classes)
    another set of labels

Returns
-------
acc : float between 0 and 1
    The rate of agreement between y1 and y2
