load_train_data(m=TRAIN_SIZE,set_small_values_to_zero=False)

This function loads the train data from the train folder, returning
the dataset X and labels y.

Parameters
----------
m : positive integer
    number of training examples to load
set_small_values_to_zero : bool
    If True, we set pixels that are nearly black to be completely
    black. I doubt this will do much one way or the other,
    but because all the images are approximately zero near the
    boundary already, I thought that I would experiment
    to see if this avoids any weirdness that might result
    from filling in values during transformations
    used for dataset augmentation.

Returns
-------
X: 4-D array with shape (m,1,IMAGE_HEIGHT,IMAGE_WIDTH)
    dataset in a channels_first format
    (with one channel as it is grayscale)
y: 2-D array with shape (m,number_of_classes)
    labels for X
